# CNN_Object_Classification_CIFAR10_dataset
 In this project, I learnt about the introductory Convolutional Neural Networks and implemented this knowledge on the CIFAR10 dataset available on tensorflow

# How to run the code
Just simply download the .ipynb file and then run in either google colab, jupyter notebook or any other python notebook app.
No changes are needed in the dataset and you can simply run this code without any prior changes because this code is universally written and it will run on any 
system. Just make sure you have the tensorflow library installed in your system so that you can run this code smoothly.

# Changes in the code
Some updates on the code might be pushed in the later phases. 

# License requirements
